make environment

transformer dataset

train ball heat map, train movement heat map

write mcts for each case

train networks through mcts

add self play

--

consideration list

use heat map to aggressively crop what mcts scenarios are looked at
- general actions, move up, down, left, right, pass, shoot
each player will have own mcts, with one general heat map
- maybe each team? -> more data efficient already doing all the simulation for one player
- the internal neat network of the player is used for curriculum learning

bucket list

add the deepmind paper so it learns from mistakes immediately
